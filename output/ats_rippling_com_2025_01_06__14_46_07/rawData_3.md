Foundational to the culture at Alton Aviation Consultancy is our singular
focus on serving the best interests of our clients with objectivity and
excellence. Our clients include a wide range of airlines, manufacturers,
aftermarket providers, lessors, lenders and airports – and investors in these
businesses. Each client entrusts our professionals with each engagement, and
in turn, we provide our best thoughts and our highest quality work with
honesty and integrity.

## One Team, Globally

Alton was established by a small number of people aligned in thinking and
focus. While our firm has grown substantially in size since formation across
geographies and cultures, we continue to function as one cohesive team,
working side by side. Individuals with different work and life experiences and
perspectives, areas of industry expertise and functional capabilities come
together on a daily basis to creatively solve the most challenging needs of
our clients.

## Responsibility

At Alton, team members at all levels embrace responsibility and
accountability. Our professionals recognize the importance of and embrace our
client-centric focus, and performing to the highest standards given the shared
sense of pride and purpose in meaningful work. As a lean and flat
organization, we encourage all team members to bring their best ideas for
consideration and discussion, unencumbered by hierarchy.

## Openness

In our offices around the globe, we have embraced a physical space wherein our
most senior team members sit side by side with our most junior team members.
This physical space reflects our commitment to an open and transparent
environment where learning thrives and new ideas and perspectives are
welcomed.

## Meritocracy

Following a similar career trajectory as many of the firm’s founders, we are
keen to help team members develop their skills, expand their knowledge, and
grow to be future leaders within the firm. We envisage career growth as a
commitment between both employee and employer, and provide regular feedback
and ongoing development. Our team members are supported with highly
competitive compensation commensurate with the firm’s performance and
individual contributions. Employees receive comprehensive benefits including
leave, healthcare, and retirement savings programs.

## Social Responsibility

Social responsibility has been core to our business values since the founding
of Alton, including both charitable contributions and direct service
opportunities. In 2017, we formalized our commitment to giving back, becoming
the first aviation and aerospace company to join Pledge 1%, a corporate
philanthropy movement dedicated to improving communities around the world. We
are proud to donate 1% of our annual revenue to charitable organizations and
1% of our time to philanthropic efforts supporting the local areas around our
Alton offices in New York, Dublin, Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, and
Beijing.
