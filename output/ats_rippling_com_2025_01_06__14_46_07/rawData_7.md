By submitting this application, I agree that I have read the [Privacy
Policy](https://3smoney-1653552517.teamtailor.com/privacy-policy) and confirm
that 3S Money store my personal details to be able to process my job

# Privacy policy for the 3S Money employer branding and recruitment

Date of publication: 07-06-2024

We at 3S Money manage our employer branding and recruitment process through
our [career site](https://3smoney-1653552517.teamtailor.com) (the “Career
Site”), and by using a related applicant tracking system.

In this privacy policy, we explain how we process your personal data if:

  1. You visit our Career Site (you being a “Visitor”)
  2. You connect with us via our Career Site, to create a profile with us and receive information about current or future vacancies with us (you being a “Connecting Candidate”)
  3. You apply for a position with us, via our Career Site or a third party service (you being an ”Applying Candidate”)
  4. We collect information about you from other parties, sites and services, since we believe your profile is of interest for our current or future vacancies (you being a “Sourced Candidate”)
  5. We receive information about you from our employees or partners, since they believe your profile is of interest for our current or future vacancies (you being a “Referred Candidate”)
  6. We receive information about you from a Candidate, who lists you as their reference (you being a “Reference”).

This privacy policy also describes what rights you have when we process your
personal data, and how you can exercise these rights.

When we use the term “Candidate” in this privacy policy, we are referring to
each of Connecting Candidates; Applying Candidates; Sourced Candidates; and
Referred Candidates, unless it’s stated otherwise.

### 1\. About processing of personal data

Personal data is all information that can be directly or indirectly linked to
a living, physical person. Examples of personal data are: name, e-mail
address, telephone number and IP address. Processing of personal data is any
automated use of personal data - such as collecting, creating, analyzing,
sharing, and deleting personal data.

There are laws and regulations on how companies may process personal data, so-
called data protection laws. Different data protection laws apply to different
types of use of personal data, and in different parts of the world. An example
of a data protection law that is relevant for our use of your personal data,
as described in this privacy policy, is the EU Data Protection Regulation
(2016/679, “GDPR”).

Most obligations under the GDPR apply to the so-called data controller. A data
controller is the entity that decides for which purposes personal data will be
processed, and how the processing will be executed. The data controller can
use a so-called data processor. A data processor is an entity that is only
allowed to process personal data as instructed by the data controller, and may
not use the personal data for its own purposes.

We are the data controller when we process your personal data as described in
this Privacy policy.

### 2\. What personal data do we process?

### 5\. Whom do we share your personal data with?

**Our service providers.** We share your personal data with our suppliers who
provide services and functionality in our employer branding- and recruitment
process. For example, this includes recruitment service providers and the
supplier of our Career Site and related applicant tracking system.

**Our group companies.** We share your personal data with our group companies,
when they provide us services and functionality to our employer branding- and
recruitment process, such as access to particular systems and software.

**Companies providing cookies on the Career Site.** If you consent to it,
cookies are set by other companies than us, who will use the data collected by
these cookies in accordance with their own privacy policy. You can find
information about which cookies this applies to in our [Cookie
Policy](https://3smoney-1653552517.teamtailor.com/cookie_policy).

**To authorities and other public actors - when we are ordered to do so.** We
will share your personal data with authorities and other public actors when we
have a legal obligation to do so.

**To parties involved in legal proceedings.** If needed to protect or defend
our rights, we share your personal data with public authorities or with other
parties involved in a potential or existing legal proceeding. This can for
example be in case of discrimination claims.

**Mergers and acquisitions etc.** In connection with a potential merger, sale
of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or part of our business to
another company, we may share your personal data to other parties involved in
the process.

### 6\. On what legal bases do we process your personal data?

To be able to process your personal data, we need to have a so-called legal
basis. A legal basis is a reason for processing the personal data that is
justified under the GDPR.

When we process your personal data for the purposes described in this Privacy
Policy, the legal basis we rely on is normally that the **processing is
necessary for our legitimate interest** in being able to recruit talent with
the relevant competence for us. We have concluded that we have a legitimate
interest in being able to perform the personal data processing for this
purpose; that the processing is necessary to achieve that purpose; and that
our interest outweighs your right not to have your data processed for this
purpose.

You can contact us for more information about how this assessment was made.
See Section 9 and 10 below for our contact information.

There may be specific circumstances when the processing is only performed if
and when you provide **your consent** to the processing. This is for example
the case if we propose to record an interview with you. Please see Section 9
below for more information about your right to withdraw your consent.

### 7\. When do we transfer your personal data outside of the EU/EEA, and how
do we protect it then?

We always strive to process your personal data within the EU/EEA area.

However, some of our service providers process your personal data outside of
the EU/EEA. We also use suppliers whose parent company, or whose
subcontractor’s parent company, is based outside the EU/EEA. In these cases,
we have taken into account the risk that the personal data may be disclosed to
countries outside the EU/EEA, for example because of an authority request.

In cases where another recipient of your personal data (as described in
Section 5 above) is based outside the EU/EEA, this will also mean that your
personal data is transferred outside the EU/EEA.

When we, or one of our suppliers, transfer your personal data outside the
EU/EEA, we will ensure that a safeguard recognized by the GDPR is used to
enable the transfer. We use the following safeguards:

  * A decision by the EU Commission that the country outside of the EU/EEA to which your personal data is transferred has an adequate level of protection, which corresponds to the level of protection afforded by the GDPR. In particular, we rely on the [EU Commission’s adequacy decision for the US via the so-called EU-US Data Privacy Framework](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3721), and the [adequacy decision for the UK.](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3183)
  * Entering into the [EU Commission’s standard clauses](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) with the recipient of the personal data outside the EU/EEA. This means that the recipient guarantees that the level of protection for your personal data afforded by the GDPR still applies, and that your rights are still protected. 

When your personal data is transferred outside the EU/EEA, we also implement
appropriate technical and organizational safeguards, to protect the personal
data in case of a disclosure. Exactly which protective measures we implement
depends on what is technically feasible, and sufficiently effective, for the
particular transfer.

### 9\. What rights do you have, and how can you exercise them?

In this section, you will find information about the rights you have when we
process your personal data. As described below, some of the rights only come
into play when we process your personal data under a particular legal basis.

If you want to exercise any of the rights listed here, we suggest that you:

  * Visit the [Data & Privacy page](https://3smoney-1653552517.teamtailor.com/data-privacy) on our Career Site, where we offer features to let you exercise your rights;

  * Contact us directly at robyn.lewin@3s.money. 

##### Right to be informed

You have the right to be informed about how we process your personal data. You
also have the right to be informed if we plan to process your personal data
for any purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.

We provide you with such information through this privacy policy, through
updates on our Career Site (see also Section 11 below), and by answering any
questions you may have for us.

##### Right to access your personal data.

You have the right to know if we process personal data about you, and to
receive a copy of the data we process about you. In connection with receiving
the copy of your data, you will also receive information about how we process
your personal data.

##### Right to access and to request a transfer of your personal data to
another recipient (“data portability”).

You can request a copy of the personal data relating to you that we process
for the performance of a contract with you, or based on your consent, in a
structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. This will allow you to use
this data somewhere else, for example to transfer it to another recipient. If
technically feasible, you also have the right to request that we transfer your
data directly to another recipient.

##### Right to have your personal data deleted (“right to be forgotten”).

In some cases, you have the right to have us delete personal data about you.
This is for example the case if it’s no longer necessary for us to process the
data for the purpose for which we collected it; if you withdraw your consent;
if you have objected to the processing and there are no legitimate, overriding
justifications for the processing. (For the separate right to object, see
below.)

##### Right to object against our processing of your personal data.

You have the right to object to processing of your personal data which is
based on our legitimate interest, by referencing your personal circumstances.

##### Right to restrict processing.

If you believe that the personal data we process about you is inaccurate, that
our processing is unlawful, or that we don’t need the information for a
specific purpose, you have the right to request that we restrict the
processing of such personal data. If you object to our processing, as
described just above, you can also request us to restrict processing of that
personal data while we make our assessment of your request.

When our processing of your personal data is restricted, we will (with the
exception of storage) only process the data with your consent or for the
establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, to protect the rights of
another natural or legal person, or for reasons relating to an important
public interest.

##### Right to rectification.

You have the right to request that we rectify inaccurate information, and that
we complete information about you that you consider incomplete.

##### Right to withdraw your consent.

When we process your personal data based on your consent, you have the right
to withdraw that consent at any time. If you do so, we will stop processing
your data for the purposes you’ve withdrawn your consent for. However, it
doesn’t affect the lawfulness of processing that was based on your consent
before it was withdrawn.

##### Right to raise a complaint.

If you have complaints about our processing of your personal data, you can
raise a complaint with the data protection authority in United Kingdom. You
can find their contact details [here](https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/).

You can also lodge a complaint with your national data protection authority,
which you can find listed [here](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-
edpb/members_en) if you are based in the EU. If you are based in the UK, you
can lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office,

any questions, comments or concerns about how we handle your personal data,
you can reach us by sending an email to robyn.lewin@3s.money.

# Privacy policy for the 3S Money employer branding and recruitment

Date of publication: 07-06-2024

We at 3S Money manage our employer branding and recruitment process through
our [career site](https://3smoney-1653552517.teamtailor.com) (the “Career
Site”), and by using a related applicant tracking system.

In this privacy policy, we explain how we process your personal data if:

  1. You visit our Career Site (you being a “Visitor”)
  2. You connect with us via our Career Site, to create a profile with us and receive information about current or future vacancies with us (you being a “Connecting Candidate”)
  3. You apply for a position with us, via our Career Site or a third party service (you being an ”Applying Candidate”)
  4. We collect information about you from other parties, sites and services, since we believe your profile is of interest for our current or future vacancies (you being a “Sourced Candidate”)
  5. We receive information about you from our employees or partners, since they believe your profile is of interest for our current or future vacancies (you being a “Referred Candidate”)
  6. We receive information about you from a Candidate, who lists you as their reference (you being a “Reference”).

This privacy policy also describes what rights you have when we process your
personal data, and how you can exercise these rights.

When we use the term “Candidate” in this privacy policy, we are referring to
each of Connecting Candidates; Applying Candidates; Sourced Candidates; and
Referred Candidates, unless it’s stated otherwise.

### 1\. About processing of personal data

Personal data is all information that can be directly or indirectly linked to
a living, physical person. Examples of personal data are: name, e-mail
address, telephone number and IP address. Processing of personal data is any
automated use of personal data - such as collecting, creating, analyzing,
sharing, and deleting personal data.

There are laws and regulations on how companies may process personal data, so-
called data protection laws. Different data protection laws apply to different
types of use of personal data, and in different parts of the world. An example
of a data protection law that is relevant for our use of your personal data,
as described in this privacy policy, is the EU Data Protection Regulation
(2016/679, “GDPR”).

Most obligations under the GDPR apply to the so-called data controller. A data
controller is the entity that decides for which purposes personal data will be
processed, and how the processing will be executed. The data controller can
use a so-called data processor. A data processor is an entity that is only
allowed to process personal data as instructed by the data controller, and may
not use the personal data for its own purposes.

We are the data controller when we process your personal data as described in
this Privacy policy.

### 5\. Whom do we share your personal data with?

**Our service providers.** We share your personal data with our suppliers who
provide services and functionality in our employer branding- and recruitment
process. For example, this includes recruitment service providers and the
supplier of our Career Site and related applicant tracking system.

**Our group companies.** We share your personal data with our group companies,
when they provide us services and functionality to our employer branding- and
recruitment process, such as access to particular systems and software.

**Companies providing cookies on the Career Site.** If you consent to it,
cookies are set by other companies than us, who will use the data collected by
these cookies in accordance with their own privacy policy. You can find
information about which cookies this applies to in our [Cookie
Policy](https://3smoney-1653552517.teamtailor.com/cookie_policy).

**To authorities and other public actors - when we are ordered to do so.** We
will share your personal data with authorities and other public actors when we
have a legal obligation to do so.

**To parties involved in legal proceedings.** If needed to protect or defend
our rights, we share your personal data with public authorities or with other
parties involved in a potential or existing legal proceeding. This can for
example be in case of discrimination claims.

**Mergers and acquisitions etc.** In connection with a potential merger, sale
of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or part of our business to
another company, we may share your personal data to other parties involved in
the process.

### 6\. On what legal bases do we process your personal data?

To be able to process your personal data, we need to have a so-called legal
basis. A legal basis is a reason for processing the personal data that is
justified under the GDPR.

When we process your personal data for the purposes described in this Privacy
Policy, the legal basis we rely on is normally that the **processing is
necessary for our legitimate interest** in being able to recruit talent with
the relevant competence for us. We have concluded that we have a legitimate
interest in being able to perform the personal data processing for this
purpose; that the processing is necessary to achieve that purpose; and that
our interest outweighs your right not to have your data processed for this
purpose.

You can contact us for more information about how this assessment was made.
See Section 9 and 10 below for our contact information.

There may be specific circumstances when the processing is only performed if
and when you provide **your consent** to the processing. This is for example
the case if we propose to record an interview with you. Please see Section 9
below for more information about your right to withdraw your consent.

### 7\. When do we transfer your personal data outside of the EU/EEA, and how
do we protect it then?

We always strive to process your personal data within the EU/EEA area.

However, some of our service providers process your personal data outside of
the EU/EEA. We also use suppliers whose parent company, or whose
subcontractor’s parent company, is based outside the EU/EEA. In these cases,
we have taken into account the risk that the personal data may be disclosed to
countries outside the EU/EEA, for example because of an authority request.

In cases where another recipient of your personal data (as described in
Section 5 above) is based outside the EU/EEA, this will also mean that your
personal data is transferred outside the EU/EEA.

When we, or one of our suppliers, transfer your personal data outside the
EU/EEA, we will ensure that a safeguard recognized by the GDPR is used to
enable the transfer. We use the following safeguards:

  * A decision by the EU Commission that the country outside of the EU/EEA to which your personal data is transferred has an adequate level of protection, which corresponds to the level of protection afforded by the GDPR. In particular, we rely on the [EU Commission’s adequacy decision for the US via the so-called EU-US Data Privacy Framework](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3721), and the [adequacy decision for the UK.](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3183)
  * Entering into the [EU Commission’s standard clauses](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) with the recipient of the personal data outside the EU/EEA. This means that the recipient guarantees that the level of protection for your personal data afforded by the GDPR still applies, and that your rights are still protected. 

When your personal data is transferred outside the EU/EEA, we also implement
appropriate technical and organizational safeguards, to protect the personal
data in case of a disclosure. Exactly which protective measures we implement
depends on what is technically feasible, and sufficiently effective, for the
particular transfer.

If you want more information about the cases in which your personal data is
transferred outside the EU/EEA you can contact us using the contact details in
Section 9 and 10 below.

### 8\. For how long do we keep your personal data?

##### All individuals

If we process your personal data for the purpose of being able to protect and
enforce our rights, we will keep your personal data until the relevant legal
issue has been fully and finally resolved.

personal data to analyse the performance of the Career Site for as long as we
keep personal data about you for other purposes.

##### Candidates

If you are a Connecting Candidate (only), we keep your personal data for as
long as you remain connected with us.

data for as long as needed to consider, and potentially contact you, for
relevant future job openings.

other purposes than those stated above, which you will be informed of.
