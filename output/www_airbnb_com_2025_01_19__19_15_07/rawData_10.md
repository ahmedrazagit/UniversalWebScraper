Manpreet was extremely accommodating and understanding with me running late on
the day of check in, which i was extremely grateful for.  
The whole house was exceptionally clean and homely. It was a little cold on
one of the nights, and when i told her she turned the heating up without
hesitation.  
A very comfortable visit. High recommended.
