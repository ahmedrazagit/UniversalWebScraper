Richason was very easy to communicate with, happy to answer questions, always
replied promptly. Place settings on dining table were a nice touch, as was
basket of snacks.  
Our group ended up not being as big as we originally planned and therefore
worked out slightly more expensive per person. But the house has sleeping
space for 6 people and it would represent really excellent value for a group
of that size.
