Everything was as described. Check in time was amended in order to facilitate
attendance at the university degree awards ceremony. The flat was clean, tidy
and check-in arrangements very easy. Ashleigh responded to a problem we had
with heating and it was responded to and fixed very speedily. Altogether a
very enjoyable experience that I would recommend to anyone wanting a stay very
near to all facilities in Leeds. Thank you Ashleigh.

Ideal location for first direct arena, well priced, plenty of space, cheaper
than a hotel for the 5 of us, Ashleigh was easy to get ahold of despite our
train being delayed and she’s very friendly. Would happily stay again for the
next gig.
