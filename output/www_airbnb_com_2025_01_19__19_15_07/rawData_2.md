[Investing in vacation rentals](https://hospitable.com/vacation-rental-
investment/) can be very profitable, but you should realize that not all
markets and properties are equal, and rental income varies per location and
property type. Buying a new rental and merely listing it on [Airbnb and its
alternatives in the UK](https://hospitable.com/airbnb-alternatives-uk/) won’t
generate profits for you. You need to invest in a property in a city with a
high demand for vacation rentals and base your decision on market research
data.

One of the most important [metrics](https://hospitable.com/airbnb-metrics/)
you should consider when choosing a market and checking out prospective
investment properties is the Airbnb average occupancy rate by city. The reason
is that, together with the average daily rate, the [occupancy
rate](https://hospitable.com/airbnb-occupancy-rate/) determines your rental
income and ROI.

If you have a STR property that attracts a lot of bookings and has a high
occupancy rate, you’ll see significant revenue generation and will be able to
build a successful business. And if you use vacation rental software like
Hospitable to streamline your business operations, you’ll save a lot of time
by automating repetitive tasks and will be able to scale even faster.

## Airbnb Average Occupancy Rate by City in the UK

Airbnb occupancy rate is the ratio of booked nights to the total number of
nights the listing is available for bookings. This metric is very important
both for [buying profitable Airbnb rental
properties](https://hospitable.com/buying-airbnb-property/) and for evaluating
the performance of your active Airbnb listings.

The average Airbnb occupancy rate varies by market. In popular tourist
destinations or cities with high demand, occupancy rates may exceed 80% or
even reach close to full occupancy. Still, 65% is considered a good average
occupancy rate for short-term rental properties.

So, how do you find the ideal Airbnb city or market in the UK that is worth
investing in? Let’s take a look at the UK STR market data provided by
[Airbtics](https://airbtics.com/) that offers [Airbnb
analytics](https://hospitable.com/airbnb-analytics/) to help STR investors
make smarter decisions.

Here is a table where you can find the occupancy rate in different UK cities
and regions that are popular among tourists, as well as information about
daily rates, annual revenue, and the number of Airbnb listings in each area.

## What Factors Influence Occupancy Rates of Short-Term Rentals?

As it was mentioned above, owners of Airbnb properties should try to achieve
an average occupancy rate of at least 65%. But in general, a good Airbnb
occupancy rate allows you to charge an average daily rate that generates the
highest possible rental income for your STR property.

The Airbnb occupancy rate is mainly affected by location, but it’s not the
only factor that influences occupancy rates. If you want to [get more
bookings](https://hospitable.com/how-to-get-more-bookings-on-airbnb/), you
shouldn’t rely only on Airbnb. List your property on other major booking
sites, such as Booking.com and Vrbo, to reach as many potential guests as
possible.

Consider creating your own direct booking website to build relationships with
your guests and drive repeat direct bookings. You don’t need any technical
skills to do that if you take advantage of Hospitable Direct. You can easily
build a fully functional direct booking website within minutes using our
professional, easy-to-customize website templates. Moreover, your website will
appear on [Google Vacation Rentals](https://hospitable.com/google-vacation-
rentals/).

The kind of guest experience that you offer will greatly influence your
occupancy rates as well. Modern travelers value amenities that make their stay
more comfortable, enjoyable, and memorable. So you need to provide not only
basic amenities like everyone else but also offer extra amenities to give more
value to your target guests and stand out from your competitors.

It’s also essential to come up with a well-planned [pricing
strategy](https://hospitable.com/airbnb-marketing-strategy/) that will help
you ensure that your rates are competitive and your property can generate
Airbnb income throughout the year. Successful hosts rely on dynamic pricing
tools that take the guesswork out of setting nightly rates for short-term
rentals and use algorithms to calculate and adjust prices in real-time based
on market conditions.

  

You should also remember that regardless of the market and the type of your
target guests, your STR property will enjoy a higher occupancy if it is
located close to major roads and public transportation. Travelers who come
with their car and people who rely on available transportation modes are sure
to appreciate this. If they see that they can easily get to your listing, they
will be more likely to book it.

Keep in mind that if you’re thinking about starting an Airbnb in the UK, you
need to protect your rental space against damage and yourself against personal
liability claims with the right insurance. Check out our blog article to find
answers to common questions about [Airbnb insurance in the
UK](https://hospitable.com/airbnb-insurance-uk/).
