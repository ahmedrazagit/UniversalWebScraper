Richason’s place was great for a big group of guests. All bedrooms and spaces
were spotless. Kitchen was set up perfectly ready for dinner. Beds were
extremely comfortable & only a 10 minute taxi ride to the city. Supermarket 5
minute walk. Thank you very much, we all loved it

Really great host and property. Two of the bathrooms were not operational
though, which was quite disappointing as we were only told on the day, but
otherwise a very good stay.
