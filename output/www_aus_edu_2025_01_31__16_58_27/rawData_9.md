As one of the most exciting branches in the dynamic field of engineering,
electrical engineering is at the forefront of how we shape the future.

The Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) is accredited by the
Commission for Academic Accreditation of the United Arab Emirates Ministry of
Higher Education and Scientific Research.

The Electrical Engineering (B.S.) program is accredited by the Engineering
Accreditation Commission of ABET,
[https://www.abet.org](javascript:aus_external_warning_ShowExternalUrlDialog\("https://www.abet.org"\);),
under the General Criteria and Program Criteria for Electrical, Computer,
Communications, Telecommunication(s) and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.

This highly acclaimed four-year Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering
(BSEE) degree program is based on a solid foundation of science and
mathematics needed to understand advanced engineering topics and applications.

We have designed the curriculum with the aim of providing breadth and depth of
knowledge across the key areas of electrical engineering that cater to the
ever-evolving needs of the world around us.

We will provide you with state-of-the-art resources in communications, control
and instrumentation, digital signal processing, microelectronics,
electromagnetics and microwaves, electric drives, power systems and biomedical
electronics.

Our highly qualified faculty members are committed to helping you develop the
intellectual, technological and personal skills that will allow you to excel
in both academia and electrical engineering careers.

Strongly connected to today's industry environment, the electrical engineering
degree is designed to ensure that, after you graduate, you will be able to
employ your knowledge, analysis and design skills in realizing engineering
systems that advance the frontiers of science and technology.
