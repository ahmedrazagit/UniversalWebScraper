Our internationally accredited mechanical engineering degree program is one of
the most dynamic in the Gulf region and is constantly responding to market
requirements and the latest developments in this exciting area of study.

The Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) is accredited by the
Commission for Academic Accreditation of the United Arab Emirates Ministry of
Higher Education and Scientific Research.

The Mechanical Engineering (B.S.) program is accredited by the Engineering
Accreditation Commission of ABET,
[https://www.abet.org](javascript:aus_external_warning_ShowExternalUrlDialog\("https://www.abet.org/"\);),
under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for Mechanical and
Similarly Named Engineering Programs.

After the junior year, you will undertake a summer internship that will
require you to work in an engineering environment for no less than five weeks.

Before you can graduate, you will have to complete a yearlong senior design
project; many of these design projects are of international caliber and are
submitted to international competitions.

Some of the past projects have included a solar car, a mini-Baja SAE all-
terrain car and a formula SAE racecar, as well as participation in the
Supermileage Vehicle Competition (SMV-SAE), the FSAE Auto-Cross Competition,
the Aircraft Design Build and the Fly AIAA-DBF Competition.

### Mission Statement

The mission of the mechanical engineering program at AUS is to educate the
engineers of tomorrow by integrating classroom theory and hands-on experience,
emphasizing the process of learning and critical thinking, conducting cutting-
edge research, and serving the engineering profession, industry and society at
large. The mechanical engineering program fosters lifelong learning, ethics
and professional development, and embraces diversity among its faculty and
student body.

### Program Educational Objectives

The objectives of the mechanical engineering degree program are to produce
graduates who will:

  * actively embrace leadership roles in the practice of mechanical engineering, conduct research and development to advance technology and foster innovation, and apply their engineering problem-solving skills as needed in the workplace
  * actively participate in on-going professional development, updating and adapting their core knowledge, and acquiring new knowledge and skills to pursue new career opportunities
  * serve the engineering profession and support sustainable development

### Student Outcomes

Upon graduation, an AUS graduate in mechanical engineering should demonstrate:

  * an ability to identify, formulate and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science and mathematics
  * an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental and economic factors
  * an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences
  * an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental and societal contexts
  * an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks and meet objectives
  * an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions
  * an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies

Our program focuses on three major areas of mechanical engineering:
thermofluids and energy systems; mechanical product design and manufacturing;
and dynamics control and mechatronics. We offer advanced technical courses in
all of these areas to insure that our graduates get the breadth as well as the
depth of education to perform at their best in the workplace. The research
areas of our faculty cover broad and contemporary areas such as:

  * energy systems
  * complex fluid flows: steady and unsteady aerodynamics, external and internal flows
  * modern real-time control systems
  * modeling and simulation of physical systems
  * composite materials: thermosets, thermoplastics, metal-metal composites and other advanced engineering materials
  * navigation systems and GPS/INS integration
  * unmanned autonomous vehicles
  * manufacturing and manufacturing process monitoring and control
  * heat transfer
  * computational fluid dynamics
  * vibration monitoring and control

We are also very proud that our department has an active American Society of
Mechanical Engineers (ASME) student chapter, as well as membership in the
Society of Automotive Engineering (SAE) and the American Institute of
Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).

Our facilities, excellent faculty and curriculum are here for one purpose, and
that is to help our students succeed in realizing their education goals. We
are committed to ensuring that our unique program will bring about a positive
change in the future of all our graduates.
