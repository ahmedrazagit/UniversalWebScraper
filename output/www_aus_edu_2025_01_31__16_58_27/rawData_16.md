disciplines, to stimulate their interest in research and to prepare them for
their future work.

**Program Outcomes**

Upon completion of the Bachelor of Science in Mathematics program, graduates
should be able to:

  * Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of diverse areas in mathematics such as analysis, algebra, discrete mathematics and applied mathematics
  * Construct and effectively communicate valid mathematical arguments
  * Demonstrate a solid grounding in the ideas and techniques of mathematics
  * Apply mathematical analysis and mathematical skills to problems in other disciplines
  * Use discrete mathematical concepts in a variety of contexts such as algorithm development, computer programming and network development and implementation
  * Demonstrate the ability to identify and carry out thoughtful approaches to problem solving
  * Define and execute simple research tasks as required for professional work
  * Formulate a problem in mathematical terms from descriptions written in language specific to disciplines associated with engineering, finance and the natural sciences
