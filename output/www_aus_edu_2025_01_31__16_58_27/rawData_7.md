At the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, we provide you with
a challenging and contemporary chemical engineering degree program enhanced by
the research accomplishments of our faculty members. We value excellence in
teaching, quality research and service, along with the intellectual
development of students in a challenging, rewarding academic environment. Our
department is known throughout the country for its diverse student body,
faculty research and the success of its alumni.

The Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering (BSChE) is **accredited** by
the Commission for Academic Accreditation of the United Arab Emirates Ministry
of Higher Education and Scientific Research.

The Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering program is **accredited** by
the Engineering Accreditation Commission of **ABET** ,
[https://www.abet.org](javascript:aus_external_warning_ShowExternalUrlDialog\("https://www.abet.org/"\);),
under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for Chemical, Biochemical,
Biomolecular and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.

The BSChE program allows students to benefit from studying in a
**multicultural environment** that fosters critical thinking, lifelong
learning, frequent opportunities to interact with faculty and staff, use of
**state-of-the-art** chemical engineering **teaching and research
laboratories** and simulation software and development of communication
skills. Providing breadth and depth of knowledge and significant design and
engineering experience, our program gives you a chance to gain **hands-on
laboratory experience** across the key areas of chemical engineering through
cutting-edge teaching and research equipment. Students also benefit from our
**industry-sponsored graduation projects** and innovative and modern teaching
methodologies including **project-based learning**.

The chemical engineering degree is tailored to serve the needs of national and
regional chemical and petroleum industries. Upon graduation, students will be
able to work in process safety, clean energy, desalination, drug delivery,
sustainability, data sciences, process modeling and control using AI and
computer aided process design. For the benefit of society at large, we also
ensure that students are educated to be environmentally and ethically
responsible.

Our comprehensive curriculum consists of a **four-year** , **132-credit**
-degree plan leading to the Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering that
meets the needs of the engineering community in the United Arab Emirates and
the Gulf region.

Our program includes university requirements and core requirements for all
chemical engineering students. In addition, each student must also complete
technical and free elective courses. The program also requires an **internship
experience** as well as a senior project accomplished over two semesters in
addition to the **innovation and entrepreneurship** course requirement.
